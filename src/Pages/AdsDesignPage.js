            In my work as an ads designer, I aim to create impactful visuals
            that leave a memorable impression. My design experience spans
            various advertising formats, such as brochures, posters, business
            cards, and packaging, each crafted to clearly communicate a brandâ€™s
            message with style. This portfolio section showcases my ability to
            blend eye-catching design with strategic messaging. I focus on
            detail, typography, and layout, ensuring each ad design is not only
            visually appealing but also functional, effectively reaching
            audiences through physical media.
